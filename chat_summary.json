The user then received two structured questions regarding the positioning of this new button and its functionality, with two options provided for each question. Later, the AI reiterated the user's request for the button and noted it would integrate a link to the \"About Us\" page, asking for more project details for context. Furthermore, another list of features was offered, including a dynamic FAQ, social media sharing buttons, a feedback form, a 'Meet the Team' section, a newsletter subscription field, and a 'Suggest a Topic' section, again indicating the user\u2019s selections. The user was posed with two more questions about the positioning of the 'About Us' link and its accessibility to users, which the AI also noted for implementation.",
